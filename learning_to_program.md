# Learning to program

Learning a computer language takes time. Learning how to learn a computer language generally takes much more. Just as with natural languages, the way it typically happens is that you struggle to learn the first new language, struggle a little less with the next, and then somewhere around the third new language, you begin to notice meta-patterns that save you lots of time. From then on, you have a schema for learning, and the features of an individual language become choices among available options, not one-off special cases.

So it's worth our while to think a little about the _generic process_ of writing computer code before we get bogged down in the details of any specific language. The hope is that this information will give you a way to think about learning _any_ computer language, not just the one you end up choosing.

## How to write a computer program

Let's think about what we need to understand to write a computer program, even a small one. For instance, we might want to know:

- What are the inputs to the program?
    + How do I load them (from a file or the internet)?
    + How do I get them from a user?
- What are the outputs of the program?
    + New or modified files?
    + Plots?
    + Statistics?
- What are the steps the program should take to solve the problem (its **algorithms**)?
- What is the information on which the program operates (**data structures**)?
- What problem-solving strategies will we use to combine algorithms and data structures (**design patterns**)?
- Can I break this program into smaller sub-programs, each of which has a single, small job?
- Are there established libraries of functions I can use?
    + What inputs do those libraries require?
    + What data structures do they offer/use?

> The most important skill for programming is the ability to break a large problem into small sub-problems. When problems are small and manageable, it is easier to decide what strategies work best to solve them.
